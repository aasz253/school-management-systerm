# Quota Management Engine (QME) Documentation

## Overview

The Quota Management Engine (QME) is a core component of EduManage Pro that automatically enforces limits on class sizes, course enrollments, and elective selections to ensure optimal resource allocation and educational quality.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-level Quota Definition**
   - Per Class/Section quotas
   - Per Course/Subject quotas
   - Per Elective Group quotas

2. **Dynamic Quota Checking**
   - Real-time validation during enrollment
   - Automatic waitlisting when quotas are full
   - Instant notification system

3. **Quota Analytics**
   - Visual dashboard for administrators
   - Utilization reports
   - Trend analysis

## How It Works

### Quota Types

#### 1. Class/Section Quotas
Limits the maximum number of students that can be enrolled in a specific class section.

Example: Grade 10-A has a quota of 30 students.

#### 2. Course/Subject Quotas
Limits the overall capacity for a subject across all sections.

Example: "Advanced Physics" can only have 100 students total across all sections.

#### 3. Elective Group Quotas
Limits choices in elective bundles.

Example: Only 25 students can choose "Music" as their art elective.

### Enrollment Process with QME

1. **Quota Check**: When a student attempts to enroll, the system performs real-time checks:
   - Class-level quota
   - Course-level quota
   - Elective group quota (if applicable)

2. **Enrollment Decision**:
   - If quota is available: Student is enrolled immediately
   - If quota is full: Student is placed on a waitlist

3. **Waitlist Management**:
   - Automatic positioning based on request time
   - Notification when spots become available
   - Automatic enrollment when possible

### API Endpoints

#### Check Quota Availability
```
POST /api/v1/quota/check
```
Checks if a student can enroll in a class based on quota restrictions.

#### Enroll Student
```
POST /api/v1/quota/enroll
```
Enrolls a student in a class with automatic quota validation.

#### Drop Student
```
DELETE /api/v1/quota/enrollments/:id
```
Drops a student from a class and processes the waitlist.

#### Get Waitlist Status
```
GET /api/v1/quota/waitlist/:studentId
```
Retrieves a student's current waitlist positions.

#### Get Quota Statistics
```
GET /api/v1/quota/statistics/:schoolId
```
Retrieves quota utilization statistics for a school.

### Data Models

#### QuotaRule
Defines quota rules for classes, courses, and elective groups.

#### Waitlist
Manages student waitlist positions for full classes/courses.

#### Enrollment
Tracks student enrollments with quota validation results.

## Implementation Details

### Race Condition Prevention

The QME uses database transactions to prevent race conditions during high-concurrency enrollment scenarios.

### Performance Optimization

- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Caching of quota data for fast retrieval
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations

### Error Handling

The system provides clear error messages when quota limits are reached:
> "Enrollment failed. The quota for [Course Name] / [Class Section] is full. Please select an alternative."

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Quota Dashboard

Administrators can view:
- Real-time quota utilization
- High-demand courses
- Under-subscribed courses
- Waitlist statistics

### Reports

- Quota utilization trends
- Enrollment patterns
- Resource allocation efficiency

## Configuration

Quota rules can be configured by Super Admins through the administrative interface:
- Set maximum limits for classes, courses, and electives
- Define elective groups
- Activate/deactivate quota rules

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check quota utilization reports regularly
2. **Proactive Planning**: Use analytics to plan for future resource needs
3. **Clear Communication**: Ensure students understand quota policies
4. **Waitlist Management**: Monitor and process waitlists promptly
